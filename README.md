This is a LaTeX template for undergraduate students at Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU) who are writing their thesis in 2023, 2024, and [2025](https://github.com/lihanshu/NWPU-Thesis-Template/issues/6). The template is designed to help students quickly complete their thesis without being bothered by formatting issues. In the future, if the university's template for any year is revised, please compare and check the changes on your own.

Presently, this template is available exclusively in Chinese.
